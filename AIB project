AIB project

implement PhantomJS for headless downloading (and speed)
downloading here: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/phantomjs/JChUakj--24/epby47h3ZGAJ

Problem would be the lack of easy portability
Better would be to download through curl or head, but this may be impossible through AIB security settings.

Make sure that I am indeed downloading every file in each month.
Include downloading of savings as well.

Fix magic number for page lower bound.



Export to csv and graph with matlibplot.

page 2


Assumptions:
-   Each page will have Date, Details, Debit €, Credit €, Balance €
    I use these to anchor my coordinates.

# Export data to csv (or even excel)
# Use matlibplot to plot wealth trend over time.
# Subdivide in categories (search by 'tesco' for example)
